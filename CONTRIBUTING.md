# Contribution Guidelines

- **To add to the list:** Submit a pull request
- **To remove from the list:** Open an issue

To set this list excellent, awesome-zephir is a specially curated list for
high-quality, actively maintained Zephir resources.

- List items should be sorted *alphabetically*.
- Each item should be limited to one link
- For links use the following format: `[List Name](link)`
- The link should be the name of the library or project
- Descriptions should be clear, concise, and non-promotional
- Descriptions should follow the link, on the same line
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are
  welcome
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion

Please contribute links to libraries/projects/resources you have used or are
familiar with. This will help ensure high-quality entries.


## Quality standard

To stay on the list, libraries/projects/resources should adhere to these
quality standards:

- Generally useful to the community
- Functional
- Actively maintained (even if that just means acknowledging open issues
  when they arise)
- Stable, or progressing toward stable
- Documented (at least PHPDoc)
- Tests are preferred (when possible)


## Reporting issues

Please open an issue if you find anything that could be improved or have
suggestions for making the list a more valuable resource. We realize sometimes
libraries/projects/resources fall into abandonment or have breaking builds for
extended periods of time or is not updated as often as would be desirable, so
if you see that, please let us know. We also realize that sometimes projects are
just going through transitions or are more experimental in nature. These can
still be cool, but we can indicate them as transitory or experimental -- again,
just open an issue. Thanks everyone!
